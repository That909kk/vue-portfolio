# CV File Instructions

To enable CV download functionality:

1. Copy your CV file (MyCV.pdf) from `src/assets/MyCV.pdf` to `public/MyCV.pdf`
2. Run this command in the project root:
   ```bash
   copy src\assets\MyCV.pdf public\MyCV.pdf
   ```
3. The download button will then work correctly

The CV file should be named exactly `MyCV.pdf` in the `public` folder.
