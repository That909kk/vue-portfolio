Backend: Built scalable RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka for messaging. Frontend: Designed and implemented a responsive interface with Reactjs. Infrastructure: Containerized services with Docker, routed traffic via Nginx, and integrated Zipkin for distributed tracing. This project helped me grasp core microservices concepts such as service independence, RESTful API design, Kafka-based communication, and traffic routing with Nginx. I also learned how Zipkin enhances debugging and monitoring across services. These experiences equipped me with the ability to build scalable, maintainable systems—skills I'm eager to apply in future full-stack development projects.",
